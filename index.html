        <h2>FOR COLLEGE COUNCIL</h2>
    </section>
    <section class="body">
        <p>Student government candidates understandably campaign with great idealism, but inaccurately assessing the feasability of various proposals often hurts actual implementation. We promise a different, more <em>grounded</em> approach. Instead of specific proposals, we offer a platform of principals and values that we promise to strive for, because we are also students, and, like you, we care. If you agree with our direction, consider voting for us.</p>

        <h2>OUR PLATFORM</h2>

        <h3>GROUNDED ADMINISTRATION</h3>

        <h4>Transparency</h4>

        <p>
            There is no excuse for a lack of transparency and communication from the administration, especially in a time like this. We will push for a precedent of openness, whether with the preregistration process or the annual budget.
        </p>

        <h4>Free Speech</h4>

        <p>
            We live in a crazy, fractured time. While we are proud of the discourse encouraged by the university’s current speech policies, we will push the administration to find ways of addressing root causes behind hate, instead of ignoring them under the preface of “free speech”.
        </p>

        <h4>UCPD</h4>

        <p>
            The UCPD is the second largest private police force in the world, with an undisclosed budget of millions of dollars. We will focus on transparency, but will also push for reducing the budget and investing the money in students of color and the Hyde Park community.
        </p>

        <h3>GROUNDED STUDENT LIFE</h3>

        <h4>In-person Programming</h4>

        <p>
            Let’s face it – meeting people over Zoom sucks. We will push for more socially distanced in-person sports/events (O-Week 2.0?), bringing a necessary a sense of urgency to the campus life revival process, particularly in the winter quarter.
        </p>

        <h4>Mental Health</h4>

        <p>
            This has never been more vital. We will establish concrete in-person mental health workshops, drawing from the empirical, powerful effects of mindfulness meditation (zazen).
        </p>

        <h4>Sustainability</h4>

        <p>
            The hands-off remodeling of UC dining has caused the unfortunate byproduct of a huge amount of waste. We will push for giving you a sustainable alternative to plastic bags/bottles, such as distributing reusable bags and opening water refill stations in a safe way.

        <p>Student government candidates understandably campaign with great idealism, but inaccurately assessing the feasability of various proposals often hurts actual implementation. By providing a list of concrete, actionable proposals, we hope to be more productive in office and do more good for the University.</p>

        <h3>GROUNDED Proposals</h3>

<h4>In-Person Event Infrastructure</h4>

The first week has shown us that safe, in-person events are possible. We will increase in-person opportunities by working with the university to single out a number of large, well-ventilated spaces (like outside tents and heated areas within the dorm), creating a system for RSOs and other groups to reserve them, and ensuring proper Covid compliance (with MANDATORY masks and social distancing). We will also work with the student government to ensure that classic UChicago traditions (like Scav) include an in-person component. We will make a platform to catalog these experiences and ensure that there is something for everyone, whether on campus, or spending the quarter at home.

<h4>Campus-wide Zazen Campaign</h4>

Staying sane and productive while also sitting inside a dorm room for 6 hours straight requires something drastic. But we’re ready: our solution is a campus-wide zen meditation (zazen) campaign. We will work with the UC Buddhist Association to organize a network of 30-60-minute weekly meditation sessions (“sits”) throughout the campus. We will also launch an intensive promotional campaign advertising zazen’s benefits I'm for productivity, energy, but also kindness, community, and so much more. But, as with all our proposals, we’d love to hear from you: let us know about any of your cultural/spiritual practices, and we will look for ways of incorporating them into our plan!

<h4>Improved Dining Hall Sustainability</h4>

The hands-off remodeling of UC dining has caused an unfortunate byproduct of a huge amount of plastic waster. This has to end. We will work to give each student reusable bags/utensils to use at the dining halls instead of the current system of plastic bags. Water refill stations are also an essential way to limit plastic waste and we will work to ensure that they are opened in a safe way throughout the dorms/dining halls.

<h4>Unwavering Accessibility</h4>

The end of our campaign will not end our conversations with you – if you elect us, you speak through us. We put forth an unwavering commitment to always give you the opportunity to influence our decisions, with weekly Zoom office hours, coffee chats, and 12-hour email response times. By providing an open and level way of communicating with us, we hope to amplify voices that are often drowned out, like those of underrepresented and marginalized students. Finally, we will work with the student government to create more avenues for reaching the administration, chiefly through a campus-wide student proposal voting platform.

<h3>Get to know our values: Transparency & Equity</h3>

<p>
There is no excuse for a lack of transparency and communication from the administration, especially in a time like this. We believe in precedent of openness, whether with the preregistration process or the annual budget.
</p>
<p>
This is especially important in the case of the UCPD. The second largest private police force in the world is subject to virtually no regulations, and their multi-million-dollar budget is a black box. We believe in making sure that you can see how your tuition is being spent to prop up this institution. Further, we believe in reducing the budget and investing the money in students of color and the Hyde Park community, along with cutting their enormous jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
The issue of equity also appears in the University's stance on free speech. While we are proud of the discourse encouraged by the university’s current policies, we will push the administration to find ways of addressing root causes behind hate, instead of ignoring them under the preface of “open discourse” and <a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2018/5/15/history-behind-kalven-report/">“the Kalven Report”</a>.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, we are students and Hyde Park is our home. Let’s take good care of it.
